<p>Materials needed: C or D cell battery, circular magnet, 2 small paperclips, 32 inches of
magnet wire, small piece of sandpaper, and some masking tape.</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>Take the magnet wire and wrap it around the battery. Slide it off the battery;
leave a straight extension on either end that acts as an axle.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sand the insulation off the part of the wire used as the axle</li>
  <li>Unbend the paperclips so they have a straight side and an eyelet at the top</li>
  <li>Tape the paperclips to the ends of the battery with the eyelet at the top</li>
  <li>Attach the magnet to the battery as seen in the drawing</li>
  <li>Slip the axles through the eyelets</li>
  <li>Give the coil a small spin -- it should begin to spin on its own</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Common problems: the insulation not thoroughly removed, paperclips not making good
  contact with the battery, the distance between the coil and the magnet
  needs to be adjusted
