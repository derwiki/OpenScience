%p
  A nice activity to put a lot of this information to use is to wire a shoe box
  house.

  Have students bring in a shoe box or small box of similar size. Run two wire
  strips across the top of the box; use a pencil and punch two holes in the top of
  the box â€“ this is where the lights will go. Connect one of the light wires to
  the wire strips on the top of the box. Connect the other light wire to a switch
  that you mounted to the side if the box. Once the light are connected, connect
  the battery to the wires on top of the box.

  (I like to use lights that you can buy at Hobby Lobby that are battery
  operated. They come in a string of 10 lights. Just cut them apart before using.
  Sometimes I can find similar lights at the Dollar Tree store)
