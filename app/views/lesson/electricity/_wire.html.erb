<h2>Wire</h2>

<p>Copper wire is getting expensive to use in some lab activities. A cheaper method
is to make your own wire using masking tape and aluminum foil.</p>

<p>Cut along the edge of the masking tape. The masking tape is the insulator and
the foil is the conductor. After cutting the strips of wire, fold each strip
long ways with the aluminum foil on the inside. If you want to connect two
strips of wire, foil over the edge of one strip so the aluminum is facing the
top of the wire. This end can be slipped into the other wire. Use tape to hold
in place. Remember when connecting two wires; metal to metal.</p>
