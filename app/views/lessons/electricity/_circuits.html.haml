  In the series circuit, the electric current goes through the first light then
  goes through the second light before returning to the battery. The problem with
  this is that if one light goes out it breaks the circuit and the other light also
  goes out. Older Christmas tree lights used to have this problem. Devices that
  take multiple batteries (like a flashlight) use a series circuit to connect the
  batteries together.

%h3 Parallel Circuit

  In a parallel circuit, the electricity splits up with some of it going to each
  of the lights. Now if one light goes out, the other remains on. This is the type
  of circuit that we use in wiring our homes.
